# Image-Outpainting-Using-Wasserstein-Generative-Adversarial-Network-with-Gradient-Penalty
In Image Outpainting (extrapolation)  we try to extend the image beyond its borders. This is similar to  our brain picturing the whole image of an object that we  partially see through a gap. This task can be achieved by using  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
